        <p>If your computer takes a long time to boot up and/or load applications this is often a hardware problem. This issue could potentially be caused my malware so we’ll discuss how to solve that now as a hardware problem can be more complex to fix. If you are unsure whether or not you have a virus you should run an anti-virus anyway. To solve a malware issue a good place to start is by downloading some anti-virus software which will search for and remove any viruses it finds, an anti-virus we can recommend is <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank">MalwareBytes</a>, once this is downloaded you can run a scan which should remove and show you whether or not you did have any viruses. Now, if your slow performance is a hardware issue, there are a couple of routes you can take to hopefully speed up your performance. The biggest performance boost you can give yourself is by upgrading the drive your operating system is on to an SSD if you haven’t already (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0784SLQM6/?cstrackid=74bf848e-46ce-49eb-9140-bf30f79a39ac" target="_blank">THIS</a> is the SSD we recommend), this will make a night and day difference compared to an operating system on a HDD and can improve your experience greatly. Another option could be upgrading the RAM in your computer, the case could be that you don’t have enough RAM. For 2020 we would recommend 16GB but if you can’t get that 8GB should be enough for simple tasks like web browsing, ideally you want to have your RAM in dual channel which will also improve performance (depending on your system one of <a href="https://flow.page/ram-upgrades" target="_blank">THESE</a> kits could work in your system).</p>
