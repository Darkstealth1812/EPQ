        <h2>Device not working</h2>
        <p>If something you have plugged in with USB or possibly 3.5mm audio jack is not working correctly or not working at all this is a peripheral issue. The most common problem will be that your device isn’t plugged in all the way if it’s USB or if it’s 3.5mm it could have been plugged into the microphone port instead of the audio port (the 3.5mm jacks look like <a href="https://support.hp.com/doc-images/488/c00587894.gif" target="_blank">THIS</a>). If your device is plugged in properly and still isn’t working, then the issue could be that you don’t have any drivers or don’t have the correct driver installed. To fix this you will need to download them by searching for your device drivers in a search engine and downloading the latest drivers. If you are still having issues, then the problem could be that your device is broken, and you will need to replace it.
