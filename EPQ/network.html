        <h2>Long loading times and Buffering</h2>
        <p>One common problem with an internet connection is having slow internet or not getting the bandwidth that you should be getting, this is noticeable when websites take a while to load or a stream like Netflix is buffering instead of playing. A cause for this could be lots of devices on the network are all using the bandwidth at the same time or you’re not using the best method of connecting to the internet. One solution to this could simply be restarting the router however sometimes this would not work, using wired internet or switching to a different frequency. 
			The way to go about fixing an issue like this would be to perform a speedtest using a website such as <a href="https://speedtest.net" target="_blank">speedtest.net</a> and compare this to the internet speed you pay for, if the results returns a similar speed maybe less by 10mbps then you are getting the speed you are paying for, the issue may be that lots of devices are using the network at the same time so you need to turn off some devices. Another solution could be that the speed you have simply isn’t fast enough for what you want to do with it and the only way to fix that issue is to contact your ISP(Internet Service Provider) and ask them about upgrading your internet package.</p>
