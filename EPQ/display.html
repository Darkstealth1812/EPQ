        <h2>No Output</h2>
        <p>If your computer is on and your screen is also on but there’s no picture then this could be a display issue, these happen all the time to everyone and are often relatively easy to fix. The most common problem is that your display cable isn’t plugged in properly or plugged into the correct display port. If you have a graphics card the problem could be that your monitor is plugged into the motherboard’s display port rather than the graphics card the graphics card’s ports should look something like <a href='https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/06/How-to-put-PC-back-together-graphics-card-display-outputs.jpg' target="_blank">THIS</a>. If your display cable is plugged into the right place, then the issue could lie with your monitor. Sometimes the monitor does not automatically change the input to adapt to how your monitor is connected, to fix this you will need to change the input through your monitor’s control panel. If this doesn’t work then the issue could be that your computer hasn’t booted correctly, in this case just shut it down and turn it back on again.
